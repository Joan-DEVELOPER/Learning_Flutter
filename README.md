# BottomBarButton 
### Welcome to my first personal Flutter app. The main objective of this application, is to understand and test with each type of Flutter button. To run the project, use the following command:

` flutter run `

### This will create a debug sessi√≥n, check if the app works without issues and launch it on the choosen platform. During the flutter debug, it will pop up a window, asking which system should be use. Select the one that fits your needs.
