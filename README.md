# Flutter Basics 
Welcome to my first personal Flutter app. The main objective of this application, is to understand and test with each widget that Flutter provides using an example of each one. You can download it and see the examples, but cannot use it for commercial purpouses.

## Setting up the app
In order to download and use this Flutter application, follow these instructions.
1. Open Git on your device
2. On the repository overview, select Code > https > copy project url
3. Run ` git clone [branchName] ` to download the Flutter Widget guide you choose on your device.
4. Run ` cd [folderName] ` to access the branch content, then run `code .` to open in on VS Code
One openeTo run the project, use the following command:

` flutter run `

This will create a debug sessi√≥n, check if the app works without issues and launch it on the choosen platform. During the flutter debug, it will pop up a window, asking which system should be use. Select the one that fits your needs.
